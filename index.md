# **Robot Components API Documentation**

Robot Components is a plugin for intuitive robot programming for ABB robots inside of Rhinoceros Grasshopper. Robot Components offers a wide set of tools to create toolpaths, simulate robotic motion and generate RAPID code within Grasshopper. Some of the main features include:

- 40+ predefined ABB robot models
- Possibility to add your own robot models
- Support for external axes (both linear and rotational)
- Possibility to define custom strategies for all external axis values
- Support for work objects (including movable work objects)
- Efficient forward and inverse kinematics
- Possibility to add your own custom code lines
- Real-time connection with IRC5 and OmniCore controllers
- Robot Components API to develop your custom components using either Python or C#

## **Getting Started**
If you use Rhino 7 or higher you can install Robot Components via the package manager. For other versions, you can download the latest release directly from the GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/RobotComponents/RobotComponents/releases) or [Food4Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/robot-components). Unzip the downloaded archive and copy all files in the Grasshopper Components folder (in GH, File > Special Folders > Components Folder). Make sure that all the files are unblocked (right-click on the file and select Properties from the menu. Click Unblock on the General tab). Restart Rhino and you are ready to go! 

In case you want to use the components from the Controller Utility section you additionally have to install [Robot Studio](https://new.abb.com/products/robotics/robotstudio) or the ABB Robot Communication Runtime (you can download it by clicking [here](https://github.com/RobotComponents/RobotComponents/raw/main/Utility/ABB%20Communication%20Runtime/ABB%20Robot%20Communication%20Runtime%202024.1.zip)). The latest release is built and tested against the ABB PC SDK version 2024.1 (ABB Robot Communication Runtime 2024.1). We do not guarantee that the Controller Utility components work with older versions of the ABB Robot Communication Runtime. Besides that, the components from the Controller Utility section are only supported on Windows operating systems. Please contact us if you have problems with establishing a real-time connection from Grasshopper.

You can find a collection of example files demonstrating the main features of Robot Components in this repository in the folder [Example Files](https://github.com/RobotComponents/RobotComponents/tree/master/ExampleFiles). You can find the Grasshopper documentation website [here](https://robotcomponents.github.io/RobotComponents-Documentation/). The documentation website of the API [here](https://robotcomponents.github.io/RobotComponents-API-Documentation/index.html).

For easy sharing of the download link and the documentation (with e.g. students) you can also use our [linktree](https://linktr.ee/RobotComponents).

## **Overview of the namespaces**

The Robot Components API consists of the following main namespaces:

**Actions:** This namespace contains all the classes to generate the RAPID program code. These are the different declarations and instructions to create a RAPID program. In the visual interface of the Grasshopper plugin these classes and the objects that are generated from these classes are categorized as code generation. This namespace also includes the RAPID generator class. 

**Controllers:** This namespace contains classes and methods to interact with ABB controllers in real-time. 

**Definitions:** This namespace contains all the classes to define robots and robot tools that are needed for simulation and code generation.

**Kinematics:** This namespace contains the inverse and forward kinematics class, and the path generator class. 

**Presets:** This namespace contains the mechanical unit presets.

**Utils:** This namespace mainly contains helper methods that are used in all other namespaces. Most of these methods are also used in the utility components in the visual interface of the Grasshopper plugin. 

## **Credits**

The plugin is an open source project that was initiated by the chair of [Experimental and Digital Design and Construction](https://www.uni-kassel.de/fb06/institute/architektur/fachgebiete/experimentelles-und-digitales-entwerfen-und-konstruieren/home) of the University of Kassel. The technical development is executed by the developers and contributors who are listed [here](https://github.com/RobotComponents/RobotComponents/blob/main/AUTHORS.md).

RobotComponents uses the ABB PC SDK for real-time connection to ABB Robots, you can find the .dll used in this project here: [ABB developercenter](http://developercenter.robotstudio.com/landing). 

Robot Components uses the OPW kinematics solver as described in the paper ['_An Analytical Solution of the Inverse Kinematics Problem of Industrial Serial Manipulators with an Ortho-parallel Basis and a Spherical Wrist_'](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264212870_An_Analytical_Solution_of_the_Inverse_Kinematics_Problem_of_Industrial_Serial_Manipulators_with_an_Ortho-parallel_Basis_and_a_Spherical_Wrist) by Mathias Brandst√∂tter, Arthur Angerer, and Michael Hofbaur.

We would like to acknowledge [Jose Luis Garcia del Castillo](https://github.com/garciadelcastillo) and [Vicente Soler](https://github.com/visose) for making their Grasshopper plugins [RobotExMachina](https://github.com/RobotExMachina) and [Robots](https://github.com/visose/Robots) available. Even though our approach is different it was helpful for us to see how you implemented certain functionalities and approached certain issues.
