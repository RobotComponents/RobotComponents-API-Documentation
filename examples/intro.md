# **Introduction**

To this API documentation, two examples are added. Both examples generate the same RAPID code for the same use case. In the first example, the use of the API inside IronPython is demonstrated. The other example is written in the C# programming language. The IronPython and C# codes are also added to the collection with Grasshopper example files. In the example, the RAPID code is generated for a robot that follows a few curves on a free-formed surface. An image of the case is given below.
