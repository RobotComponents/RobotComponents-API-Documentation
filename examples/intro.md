# **Introduction**

The API documentation contains two examples that illustrate the same use case, generating RAPID code for a robot that follows curves on a free-formed surface. One example showcases the use of the API in IronPython, while the other is implemented in C#. Additionally, both IronPython and C# codes have been included in the Grasshopper example files collection. The corresponding image of the example is provided below.
